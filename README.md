DESCRIPTION:: This is a Song Lyric Full stack application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It allows users to view, add, edit, and delete song Lyrics from the database. The application follows RESTful routing principles and uses MVC architecture. Users can navigate through different views to perform various actions such as adding a new Lyric, editing existing Lyrics, and viewing details of each Lyric.

4.Start the application by running command: npm run dev. 5.Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Also create an account in mongodb-atlas and add ip address 0.0.0.0/0 so that we can access the database on different networks and copy the connection link with password and save it in .env file

Insights and Results: Acquired knowledge on constructing RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js. Successfully integrated MongoDB as the database backend for the application.
